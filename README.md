This is a basic game, made for the Junior Programmer Pathway on learn.unity.com

Inspired by "Fruit Ninja" type of games. In this game, you have to click on all the foods that spawn. If you click on a bomb, the game will substract 10 points for the amount.

You can lose by leaving one of the food items, or by having a negative score

Good Luck!
